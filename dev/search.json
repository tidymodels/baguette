MARS: MARS models include backwards elimination feature selection routine looks reductions generalized cross-validation (GCV) estimate error. earth() function tracks changes model statistics, GCV, predictor accumulates reduction statistic predictor's feature added model. total reduction used variable importance measure. predictor never used MARS basis functions final model (pruning), importance value zero. baguette wraps earth::evimp(). C5.0: C5.0 measures predictor importance determining percentage training set samples fall terminal nodes split. example, predictor first split automatically importance measurement 100 percent since samples affected split. predictors may used frequently splits, terminal nodes cover handful training set samples, importance scores may close zero. Note value column average importance scores form model. divisor average (corresponding standard error) number models (opposed number models used predictor). means importance scores predictor used model implicit zero importance.","code":""},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://baguette.tidymodels.org/dev/news/index.html","id":"baguette-110","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"baguette 1.1.0","title":"baguette 1.1.0","text":"CRAN release: 2025-01-28 Small update improved error warning logging.","code":""},{"path":"https://baguette.tidymodels.org/dev/news/index.html","id":"baguette-102","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"baguette 1.0.2","title":"baguette 1.0.2","text":"CRAN release: 2024-02-13 Move earth package Suggests due CRAN note TeachingDemos (#71).","code":""},{"path":"https://baguette.tidymodels.org/dev/news/index.html","id":"baguette-101","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"baguette 1.0.1","title":"baguette 1.0.1","text":"CRAN release: 2023-04-04 Added \"nnet\" method bagger().","code":""},{"path":"https://baguette.tidymodels.org/dev/news/index.html","id":"baguette-100","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"baguette 1.0.0","title":"baguette 1.0.0","text":"CRAN release: 2022-06-17 Enable case weights bagger().","code":""},{"path":"https://baguette.tidymodels.org/dev/news/index.html","id":"baguette-020","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"baguette 0.2.0","title":"baguette 0.2.0","text":"CRAN release: 2022-03-09 Model definitions moved parsnip (#47)","code":""},{"path":"https://baguette.tidymodels.org/dev/news/index.html","id":"baguette-011","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"baguette 0.1.1","title":"baguette 0.1.1","text":"CRAN release: 2021-07-14 Bug fix cases CART find split (#37) Updated internal usage soft-deprecated argument hardhat::default_formula_blueprint().","code":""},{"path":"https://baguette.tidymodels.org/dev/news/index.html","id":"baguette-010","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"baguette 0.1.0","title":"baguette 0.1.0","text":"CRAN release: 2020-10-28 Added encoding information work current version parsnip.","code":""},{"path":"https://baguette.tidymodels.org/dev/news/index.html","id":"baguette-0009000","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"baguette 0.0.0.9000","title":"baguette 0.0.0.9000","text":"Development version","code":""}]
